# Basketball Moneyball

When most people hear the term "Moneyball", their minds go to the popular movie starring Brad Pitt and Jonah Hill. The basic premise of this, frankly, great movie was that the 2002 Oakland Athletics were faced with the uneviable task of assembling a championship-calibur roster within a budget that was approximately a third of the size of the other competitive teams. The 2001 Oakland Athletics had finished the season with 102 wins and had suffered a crushiing loss to the New York Yankees, a team en-route to its fourth consecutive world series appearance and fifth in 6 years. To make matters worse, the Oakland Athletics were quickly outbid in thier attempts to resign three key players: first baseman and 2000 American League MVP Jason Giambi signed with the aforementioned New York Yankees, outfielder Johnny Damon signed with Boston Red Sox, and relief pitcher Jason Isringhausen signed with the St. Louis Cardinals. 

The loss of these key players should have devastated the franchise and eliminated them from contention but remarkably the exact opposite happened. While they again lost in 5 games in the ALDS, they somehow managed to not only remain competitive but even win more games than they had the previous season. They won the exact same number of games as the New York Yankees that season after losing their best offensive player to them and with a fraction of the payroll. How did they accomplish this seemingly impossible goal? As everyone should do when operating within a tight budget, they micromanaged their their expenses. Rather than evaluating players with traditional statistics like batting average, they developed advanced statistics that correlated more strongly with winning games. They used these advanced statistics to find undervalued players that they could afford and were able to assemble a championship contending team. 

My goal in this work is to apply a similar logic, albeit a different methodology, to the evaluation of basketball players. Traditional statistics like points per game do not necessarily correlate with winning, are there more advanced stats that I can calculate that might allow us to find undervalued NBA players that could help a team contending for a championship? 

To do this, I calculated the regularized adjusted plus-minus score for every NBA playyer between 2011 and 2016 with aggregated data for the most common 5-player lineups during each season. Anyone who has ever been involved in the game of basketball has heard the phrase, "defense and rebounding wins championships". While both important, coach's are mainly trying to express the importance of these overlooked aspects of the game. However, the truest statement about what it takes to win is, "outscoring your opponent wins championships". While this is certainly a pedantic correction, this is exactly what RAPM tries to measure. How much does a team outscore their opponent on average with player X on the court? 

We can calculate RAPM by first assembling a collection of individual plus/minus statistics for players. Plus/minus is the net score for a player while he is on the court. The problem with this statistic in isolation is that average players could have inflated plus/minus scores simply by being present on a very strong team. So how do we isolte his contribution to determine if he is the main cause for the plus/minus, or more of an bystander? I scraped the NBA.com website for plus/minus information for every player. Unfortunately, 

Ideally, we would have had more snippits but we had to work within the confines of our data constraints. Codes were used to scrape plus/minus snippits and player salary info during that periiod. Note that a player could begin or end his NBA career within that time-frame as well, resulting in some missing salary information data. We resolved this by imputing the missing values with their average salaries. So, how do we actually compute RAPM?
