When most people hear the term "Moneyball", their minds go to the popular movie starring Brad Pitt and Jonah Hill. The basic premise of this, frankly, great movie was that the 2002 Oakland Athletics were faced with the uneviable task of assembling a championship-calibur roster within a budget that was approximately a third of the size of the other competitive teams. The 2001 Oakland Athletics had finished the season with 102 wins and had suffered a crushiing loss to the New York Yankees, a team en-route to its fourth consecutive world series appearance and fifth in 6 years. To make matters worse, the Oakland Athletics were quickly outbid in thier attempts to resign three key players: first baseman and 2000 American League MVP Jason Giambi signed with the aforementioned New York Yankees, outfielder Johnny Damon signed with Boston Red Sox, and relief pitcher Jason Isringhausen signed with the St. Louis Cardinals. 

The loss of these key players should have devastated the franchise and eliminated them from contention but remarkably the exact opposite happened. While they again lost in 5 games in the ALDS, they somehow managed to not only remain competitive but even win more games than they had the previous season. They won the exact same number of games as the New York Yankees that season after losing their best offensive player to them and spending a fraction of the money. How did they accomplish this seemingly impossible goal? As everyone should do when operating within a tight budget, they changed the way they viewed their costs. Rather than evaluating players with traditional statistics like batting average, they developed advanced statistics that correlated with winning games. They used these statistics to find undervalued players that they could afford and were able to assemble a championship contending team. 

My goal in this work is to apply a similar logic, albeit a different methodology, to the evaluation of basketball players.
